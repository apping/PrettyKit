/** `PrettyNavigationBar` is a subclass of `UINavigationBar` that removes the
 glossy effect and lets you customize its colors and corners.

 You can change the navigation bar appearance as follows:
 
 - shadow opacity
 - gradient start color
 - gradient end color
 - top line volor
 - bottom line color
 - corner radius
